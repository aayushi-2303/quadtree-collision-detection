# Collision detection using QuadTrees
Collision detection using QuadTrees in C++. Built on top of a custom game engine built by YouTube user ChiliTomatoNoodle (many thanks for building such a lightweight and easy to use engine!). Base framework and driver code not uploaded due to potential copyright issues.

This project is a work-in-progress in terms of code efficiency.

Many thanks to YouTube user ChiliTomatoNoodle for allowing public use of his engine.
